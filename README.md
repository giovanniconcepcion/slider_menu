# slider_menu
Custom slider menu for WordPress

You can either paste the code in nav.php directly into the header.php file or use PHPCode Snippets to create a shortcode and insert into a builder plugin(ex. Elementor)

Use Insert Headers and Footers to place the <script></script> code in nav.php into the footer of the website

And place the nav-styles.css code wherever your other css is located.
